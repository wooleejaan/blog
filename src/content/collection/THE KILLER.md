> THE KILLER, David Fincher, Netflix, 2023.

My process is purely logistical, narrowly focused by design. I’m not here to take sides. It’s not my place to formulate any opinion. No one who can afford me needs to waste time winning me to some case. I serve no God or country. I fly no flag. If I’m effective, it’s because of one simple fact. I don’t give a fuck.

···

Stick to the plan. Anticipate, don’t improvise. Trust no one. Never yield an advantage. Fight only the battle you’re paid to fight. Forbid empathy. Empathy is weakness. Weakness is vulnerability. Each and every step of the way, ask yourself, “What’s in it for me?”. This is what it takes. What you must commit yourself to … if you want to succeed. Simple.

···

It’s nothing personal. We’ve all had to work through the occasional civilian who’s stood between eyes and the prize. When I started, I was surprised at what I was capable of. How easy it was. Shockingly. Yet, I assured myself there were some things I would never do. Money was motivation. Which… once there was enough, could be used to buy another life. Another lie we told ourselves. When, for example, was the last time you bothered to ask yourself why someone in your sights was so thoroughly despised? “One man’s cruelty is another man’s pragmatism.” That old chestnut. ······ A hunter goes into the woods, and he sees this grizzly. Biggest he’s ever seen. He raises his rifle, and he fires. The bear falls, the hunter rushes forward, and to his surprise, there’s nothing there. There’s no bear, there’s no broken twigs, there’s no blood. And then suddenly, the grizzly throws this massive arm around his shoulders and explains, “You took your shot.” “You missed, so either I feast, or, and the choice is yours, I sodomize you.” Naturally, the hunter chooses life. The next day, the hunter returns to the woods with a much bigger gun, and he spots the bear again. And he aims. He fires. The bear falls. The hunter charges. No sign of the bear, until the bear is standing beside him, saying, “You know the deal.” Indignity ensues. The following day, the hunter treks back to the wood. This time with a bazooka. He sees the bear, lines him up in his crosshairs, fires. The recoil from the bazooka throws him backwards. And he looks up as the smoke’s clearing, and there’s the bear standing above hime, arms crossed. And the bear squints. “You’re not really out here for the hunting, are you?”
