> David Smyth, “Cigarettes After Sex interview: ‘I was never bashful about making bedroom music’, The Standard, 22 november 2019”

“I haven’t put it on myself but I have heard my music in bed,” he admits. “There was a time when girlfriends I had would put on my songs. They would say, ‘Can we put Cigarettes on right now?’ and I would say, ‘I guess so. That’s what it was meant for!’ It is kind of bedroom music. I was never bashful about it. It’s fine.”

“If you’re intimate with someone, you wouldn’t be speaking in the voice I am now. It would be quiet and gentle and mellow. That’s the voice of Cigarettes.”
