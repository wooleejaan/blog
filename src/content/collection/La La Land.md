> 'La La Land', directed by Damien Chazelle, 2016.

"How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist?"

"They worship everything and they value nothing."

"People love what other people are passionate about."

"How'd you find me here?" // "The house in front of the library."

"I'm letting life hit me until it gets tired. Then I'll hit back. It's a classic rope-a-dope."

"Maybe I'm one of those people that was always wanted to do it, but it's like a pipe dream for me, you know?"

"Where are we?" // "We are just gonna wait and see."

"Here's to the ones who dream. Foolish, as they may seem. Here's to the hearts that ache. Here's to the mess we make."
