”learn how to make clothes, learn how to make clothes, learn how to make clothes. don’t do sketches and collages. ··· you have to learn how to make clothes and then the other thing is you have to shut up and work and work and work all the time. and produce and produce and produce, and more you produce, your character or your talent will emerge. For better for worse, your identity, your personality, your vision whatever. As long as you have work and work and work and make enough things to choose from, you’ll be able to have an edit, you’ll be able to edit something that becomes who you are. it’s so simple. yeah I mean you don’t have to like go to parties, you don’t have to meet the right people, you know, you just have to like work and work and work and get your stuff out there.”
