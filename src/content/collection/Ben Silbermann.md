I always looked up to anybody that made things whether it was an architect or an engineer or an artist.

···

what do we just want to see and really what we wanted to see was we wanted to see something out there in the world. we just wanted to see somebody using something.

···

even though we had all these ideas for great features that we were cramming in, we weren't great at one thing. There wasn't one thing that was special about it. People talk a lot about a Minimum Viable Product or when you should ship something, and my advice is that you should ship when you have one thing that you're proud of—something that is worthy of someone's time.
