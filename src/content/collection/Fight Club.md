> David Fincher, (1999). Fight Club.

”In the world I see, you’re stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You’ll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You’ll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Towers. And when you look down, you’ll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.”

···

”Trust me. Everything’s gonna be fine.”
“You met me at a very strange time in my life.”
