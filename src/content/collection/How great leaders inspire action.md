What’s your purpose? What’s your cause? What’s your belief? Why does your organization exist? Why do you get out of bed in the morning? And why should anyone care?

The inspired leaders and the inspired organizations - regardless of their size, regardless of their industry — all think, act and communicate from the inside out. … Here’s how Apple actually communicates. “Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Want to buy one?” … What it proves to us is that people don’t buy what you do. people buy why you do it.

People don’t buy what you do. they buy why you do it. The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have. The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
