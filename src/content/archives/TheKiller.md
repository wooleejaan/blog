데이비드 핀처 감독 작품.<br>
마이클 패스벤더의 목소리에서 낮은 목소리가 어울리는 영화였고, 틸다 스윈튼의 대사가 인상적이었다.

단 한 번도 실수해 본 적 없는, 그래서 엄격하고 자기 확신에 가득 찬 킬러가 실수를 하는 것에서 시작하는 것도 좋다.<br>
예견된 죽음 앞에서 패스벤더를 비난하고자 사냥꾼 이야기를 털어놓는 틸다 스윈튼의 표정과 몸짓도 좋다.<br>
그녀의 이야기를 들어보면, 패스벤더의 실수가 과연 실수인지에 대해 곱씹어 보게 된다.<br>
영화의 시작에서 자연스럽게 느낀 의문점이 틸다 스윈튼과의 대화 장면에서 해소가 된다.<br>

킬러의 철학을 마이클 패스벤더의 목소리로 들어서 좋았고, 킬러의 모순을 틸다 스윈튼의 목소리로 들어서 좋았다.

"luck isn't real. Nor is karma, or sadly, justice. As much as I'd like to pretend these concepts exist… …they just don't. One is born, lives their life. And eventually, one dies. In the meantime, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." To quote… …someone. Can't remember who."

"Nothing I've ever done will make any dent
in these metrics."

"I've come to realize that the moment when it's time to act is not when risk is greatest. The real problems arise in the days, hours, and minutes leading up to the task and the minutes, hours, and days after. It all comes down to preparation, attention to detail, redundancies, redundancies, and redundancies."

"When I started, I was surprised at what I was capable of. How easy it was. Shockingly. Yet, I assured myself there were some things I would never do. Yet, I assured myself there were some things I would never do. Money was motivation. Which… once there was enough, could be used to buy another life. Another lie we told ourselves. When, for example, was the last time you bothered to ask yourself why someone in your sights was so thoroughly despised? Less you know, the better.
"One man's cruelty is another man's pragmatism." That old chestnut."

"Indignity ensues. The following day, the hunter treks back to the wood. This time with a bazooka. He sees the bear, lines him up in his crosshairs, fires. The recoil from the bazooka throws him backwards. And he looks up as the smoke's clearing, and there's the bear standing above him, arms crossed. And the bear squints. "You're not really out here for the hunting, are you?" Most likely. But not clean, you wouldn't. Why take this risk? Desperate for conversation. I'm flattered, but no. You're here because you couldn't help yourself. You expected to sit across from me and feel nothing but reassured. Like that recent day when you shouldered your weapon and somehow… missed. -[bottle opens] -How's it possible? Having prepared myself for this moment for so long, I have failed to believe that it would ever arrive."
