”learn how to make clothes, learn how to make clothes, learn how to make clothes. don’t do sketches and collages. ··· you have to learn how to make clothes and then the other thing is you have to shut up and work and work and work all the time. and produce and produce and produce, and more you produce, your character or your talent will emerge. For better for worse, your identity, your personality, your vision whatever. As long as you have work and work and work and make enough things to choose from, you’ll be able to have an edit, you’ll be able to edit something that becomes who you are. it’s so simple. yeah I mean you don’t have to like go to parties, you don’t have to meet the right people, you know, you just have to like work and work and work and get your stuff out there.”

### Begin Again (directed by John Carney, 2013)

What kind of music you got on your phone?<br>
I'm not giving you access to my music library. I'm really not. There's a lot of embarrassing, very guilty pleasures in there.<br>
Mine, too. You can tell a lot about a person by what's on their playlist.<br>
I know you can. That's what's worrying me.<br>
So are we gonna do this?<br>
Okay.

### The Killer (Directed by David Fincher)

"luck isn't real. Nor is karma, or sadly, justice. As much as I'd like to pretend these concepts exist… …they just don't. One is born, lives their life. And eventually, one dies. In the meantime, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law." To quote… …someone. Can't remember who."

"Nothing I've ever done will make any dent
in these metrics."

"I've come to realize that the moment when it's time to act is not when risk is greatest. The real problems arise in the days, hours, and minutes leading up to the task and the minutes, hours, and days after. It all comes down to preparation, attention to detail, redundancies, redundancies, and redundancies."

"When I started, I was surprised at what I was capable of. How easy it was. Shockingly. Yet, I assured myself there were some things I would never do. Yet, I assured myself there were some things I would never do. Money was motivation. Which… once there was enough, could be used to buy another life. Another lie we told ourselves. When, for example, was the last time you bothered to ask yourself why someone in your sights was so thoroughly despised? Less you know, the better.
"One man's cruelty is another man's pragmatism." That old chestnut."

"Indignity ensues. The following day, the hunter treks back to the wood. This time with a bazooka. He sees the bear, lines him up in his crosshairs, fires. The recoil from the bazooka throws him backwards. And he looks up as the smoke's clearing, and there's the bear standing above him, arms crossed. And the bear squints. "You're not really out here for the hunting, are you?" Most likely. But not clean, you wouldn't. Why take this risk? Desperate for conversation. I'm flattered, but no. You're here because you couldn't help yourself. You expected to sit across from me and feel nothing but reassured. Like that recent day when you shouldered your weapon and somehow… missed. -[bottle opens] -How's it possible? Having prepared myself for this moment for so long, I have failed to believe that it would ever arrive."

**Norah jones - Good morning**<br>
Good morning<br>
My thoughts on leaving<br>
Are back on the table<br>
I thought you should know<br>
And maybe powerful actions<br>
Or powerful feelings<br>
Will keep me from going<br>
···

**Norah jones - Happy Pills**<br>
Tryin' to pick up the pace<br>
Tryin' to make it so I never see your face again<br>
Time to throw this away<br>
Wanna to make sure that you never waste my time again<br>

### Cypher, the traitor from The Matrix

I know this steak dosen't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth. the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss. I don't want to remember nothing.<br>
···

If I had to choose between that and the Matrix, I choose the Matrix.
The Matrix isn't real. I think the Matrix can be more real than this world.<br>

### Bluebeard's Castle from You, Season 1 on Netflix

<img src="/images/you/1.jpg" width="500px" height="300px" title="you 1"/>

[Beck] How the hell did you end up here?<br>
[Joe] Your life has been better since you met me.<br>
You just didn't know how or why.<br>
Someone who could hurt people, who could do terrible things.<br>
[Beck] "You used to wrap yourself In fairy tales<br>
Like a blanket<br>
But it was the cold you loved<br>
Sharp shivers as you uncovered The corpses of Bluebeard's wives<br>
Sweeter goosebumps as Prince Charming<br>
Slid one glass slipper Over your little toes<br>
A perfect fit<br>
But by the schoolyard, real princesses Floated by you on fall winds<br>
You saw the gulf Between you and the rich girls<br>
And vowed to stop believing In fairy tales<br>
But the stories were in you Deep as poison<br>
If Prince Charming was real If he could save you<br>
You needed to be saved From the unfairness of everything<br>
When would he come?<br>
The answer was a cruel shrug In a hundred fleeting moments<br>
The sneer on Stevie Smith's face When he called you a fat cow<br>
Uncle Jeff's hand squeezing your ass In the Thanksgiving kitchen<br>
The accusation in your father's eyes When you told him what happened<br>
From every boy masquerading as a man That you let into your body, your heart<br>
You learned you didn't have Whatever magic turns a beast into a prince<br>
You surrounded yourself With the girls you'd always resented<br>
Hoping to share their power And you hated yourself<br>
And that diminished you even more<br>
And then, right when you thought You might just disappear<br>
He saw you<br>
And you knew somewhere deep It was too good to be true<br>
But you let yourself be swept<br>
Because he was the first Strong enough to lift you<br>
Now in his castle you understand<br>
Prince Charming and Bluebeard Are the same man<br>
And you don't get a happy end Unless you love both of him<br>
Didn't you want this?<br>
To be loved? Didn't you want him to crown you?<br>
Didn't you ask for it? Didn't you ask for it?<br>
Didn't you ask for it?<br>
So say you can live like this<br>
Say you love him Say thank you<br>
Say anything but the truth<br>
What if you can't love him back?"<br>
[Joe] What if you're not the one?<br>
