넷플릭스 너의 모든 것(YOU) 시즌 1 에피소드 10.<br>
YOU에서 가장 좋아하는 벡의 독백 장면.

10화의 푸른 수염의 성(Bluebeard's Castle)은 프랑스 민담의 푸른 수염.<br>
푸른 수염은 여러 차례 결혼을 했으나 매번 아내가 실종된 귀족.<br>
그와 결혼한 호기심 많은 아내가 작은 방을 열었을 때 아내들의 시체를 발견하는 내용.<br>

벡은 백마 탄 왕자인 줄 알았던 조가 푸른 수염이라는 걸 깨닫는다.<br>
벡이 늘 꿈꿔왔던 사랑의 현실은 서점 지하에 있는 방음 처리된 유리 구조물에 갇힌 자기 자신.<br>

시즌1의 모든 서사(사실 전 시즌을 관통한다고 생각함)를 요약하는 장면.<br>
조와 벡이 가진 각자의 왜곡된 사랑을 민담으로 풀어낸 에피소드.<br>
서로 다른 언어로 사랑을 말했고, 가장 비극적인 결말을 보여준 듯 하다.<br>
깨달은 벡은 죽었고, 깨닫지 못한 조가 살아남아 시즌이 계속 이어진다.

다른 시즌들도 정말 재밌지만 이 장면 때문에 시즌1만 몇번이고 돌려봤다.

[Beck] How the hell did you end up here?<br>
[Joe] Your life has been better since you met me.<br>
You just didn't know how or why.<br>
Someone who could hurt people, who could do terrible things.<br>
[Beck] "You used to wrap yourself In fairy tales<br>
Like a blanket<br>
But it was the cold you loved<br>
Sharp shivers as you uncovered The corpses of Bluebeard's wives<br>
Sweeter goosebumps as Prince Charming<br>
Slid one glass slipper Over your little toes<br>
A perfect fit<br>
But by the schoolyard, real princesses Floated by you on fall winds<br>
You saw the gulf Between you and the rich girls<br>
And vowed to stop believing In fairy tales<br>
But the stories were in you Deep as poison<br>
If Prince Charming was real If he could save you<br>
You needed to be saved From the unfairness of everything<br>
When would he come?<br>
The answer was a cruel shrug In a hundred fleeting moments<br>
The sneer on Stevie Smith's face When he called you a fat cow<br>
Uncle Jeff's hand squeezing your ass In the Thanksgiving kitchen<br>
The accusation in your father's eyes When you told him what happened<br>
From every boy masquerading as a man That you let into your body, your heart<br>
You learned you didn't have Whatever magic turns a beast into a prince<br>
You surrounded yourself With the girls you'd always resented<br>
Hoping to share their power And you hated yourself<br>
And that diminished you even more<br>
And then, right when you thought You might just disappear<br>
He saw you<br>
And you knew somewhere deep It was too good to be true<br>
But you let yourself be swept<br>
Because he was the first Strong enough to lift you<br>
Now in his castle you understand<br>
Prince Charming and Bluebeard Are the same man<br>
And you don't get a happy end Unless you love both of him<br>
Didn't you want this?<br>
To be loved? Didn't you want him to crown you?<br>
Didn't you ask for it? Didn't you ask for it?<br>
Didn't you ask for it?<br>
So say you can live like this<br>
Say you love him Say thank you<br>
Say anything but the truth<br>
What if you can't love him back?"<br>
[Joe] What if you're not the one?<br>
